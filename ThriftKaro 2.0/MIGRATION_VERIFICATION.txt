   - Fix: Updated to MongoDB Atlas connection
   - File: EventService/src/main/resources/application.properties

3. Service Name Mismatch:
   - Issue: Cart service name mismatch in Eureka
   - Fix: Changed spring.application.name to "cart"
   - File: cart/src/main/resources/application.properties

4. Start Script Update:
   - Issue: start-services.bat showing wrong port for EventService
