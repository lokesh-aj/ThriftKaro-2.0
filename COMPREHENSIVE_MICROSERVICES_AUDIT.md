# Comprehensive Microservices Migration Audit Report

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Project:** ThriftKaro E-Commerce Platform

## Executive Summary

This audit reveals that the ThriftKaro project is **partially migrated** to microservices architecture. Most services have been successfully migrated to Spring Boot microservices, but the **Event Service** is still running on the legacy Node.js backend.

## Issues Identified

### üö® Critical: Event Service Not Migrated

**Problem:**
- The Event Service is still running on the legacy Node.js backend
- Gateway configuration line 138-142 shows: `spring.cloud.gateway.server.webflux.routes[18].uri=http://localhost:8000`
- This creates a dependency on the old Node.js backend

**Impact:**
- Cannot fully decommission Node.js backend
- Mixed technology stack increases maintenance burden
- No circuit breaker pattern for events (line 142 references fallback but no resilience)
- Inconsistent authentication/authorization patterns

**Event Service Features (from backend/controller/event.js):**
1. Create Event (promotional/flash sales)
2. Get All Events
3. Get Shop Events
4. Delete Shop Event
5. Admin: Get All Events

**Event Model Schema:**
- name, description, category
- start_Date, Finish_Date, status
- tags, originalPrice, discountPrice, stock
- images (Cloudinary integration)
- shopId, shop object
- sold_out counter

---

## Gateway Configuration Analysis

### ‚úÖ Proper Routes (Microservices)
- Routes 0-11, 13-17: All properly configured to use service discovery (`lb://ServiceName`)
- Circuit breakers configured for resilience
- CORS properly configured for frontend
- JWT authentication configured

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Legacy Route
- **Route 18:** Event Service still pointing to `http://localhost:8000`
- This is a hardcoded URL, not using service discovery
- Comment says "Temporary - not yet migrated to microservices"

---

## Node.js Backend Status

**Current State:**
- The `backend/` directory contains the full legacy application
- All routes are still registered in `backend/app.js`
- **Only the Event Service is actually being used by the gateway**

**Services in Node.js Backend (backend/app.js):**
- ‚úÖ `/api/v2/user` - **REPLACED** by UserService
- ‚úÖ `/api/v2/shop` - **REPLACED** by ShopService
- ‚úÖ `/api/v2/product` - **REPLACED** by ProductService
- ‚ùå `/api/v2/event` - **STILL IN USE** (not migrated)
- ‚úÖ `/api/v2/coupon` - **REPLACED** by OrderService
- ‚úÖ `/api/v2/payment` - **REPLACED** by PaymentService
- ‚úÖ `/api/v2/order` - **REPLACED** by OrderService
- ‚úÖ `/api/v2/conversation` - **REPLACED** by ChatService
- ‚úÖ `/api/v2/message` - **REPLACED** by ChatService
- ‚úÖ `/api/v2/withdraw` - **REPLACED** by OrderService

## Migration Requirements

### To Complete Full Migration to Microservices:

#### 1. Create EventService Microservice (New Service)

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Create new Spring Boot service: `EventService`
- [ ] Port: 8089 (following the pattern)
- [ ] MongoDB integration for Event entities
- [ ] Cloudinary integration for image uploads
- [ ] Endpoints to migrate:
  - `POST /api/v2/event/create-event`
  - `GET /api/v2/event/get-all-events`
  - `GET /api/v2/event/get-all-events/:id`
  - `DELETE /api/v2/event/delete-shop-event/:id`
  - `GET /api/v2/event/admin-all-events` (admin only)
- [ ] JWT authentication/authorization
- [ ] Register with Eureka service discovery
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern

#### 2. Update Gateway Configuration
- [ ] Replace legacy route 18 with proper service discovery route
- [ ] Add circuit breaker for EventService
- [ ] Remove hardcoded `http://localhost:8000` reference

#### 3. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test all event operations through new EventService
- [ ] Verify Cloudinary image uploads work
- [ ] Test admin event endpoints with JWT
- [ ] Verify frontend event creation/display works

#### 4. Decommission Node.js Backend
- [ ] Verify no services are using Node.js backend
- [ ] Stop Node.js backend server
- [ ] Archive or remove `backend/` directory
- [ ] Update documentation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority: HIGH)
1. **Create EventService microservice** - This is the only missing piece
2. **Update gateway configuration** - Remove legacy Node.js dependency
3. **Test end-to-end event flow** - Ensure no regressions

### Future Improvements (Priority: MEDIUM)
1. **Implement API versioning strategy** - Currently using `/api/v2/`
2. **Add distributed tracing** - Implement Spring Cloud Sleuth + Zipkin
3. **Enhance monitoring** - Add Spring Boot Actuator metrics to all services
4. **Implement centralized logging** - Use ELK stack or similar
5. **Add API documentation** - Swagger/OpenAPI for all microservices
6. **Implement rate limiting** - Currently configured but may need tuning

### Code Quality (Priority: LOW)
1. Clean up old Node.js backend code after migration
2. Consolidate documentation files
3. Remove unused dependencies from package.json

---

## Conclusion

**Migration Status:** ~90% Complete

The ThriftKaro project has successfully migrated 10 out of 11 services to microservices architecture. Only the **Event Service** remains in the legacy Node.js backend. Once the EventService microservice is created and deployed, the project will be fully migrated to microservices architecture, and the legacy Node.js backend can be completely decommissioned.

The frontend is already properly configured to use the gateway, so no frontend changes will be needed after the EventService migration.

---

## Next Steps

1. Create EventService microservice (Spring Boot)
2. Update gateway configuration to route to EventService
3. Test all event-related functionality
4. Decommission Node.js backend
5. Update documentation
6. Celebrate! üéâ
